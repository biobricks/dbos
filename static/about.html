      <h2 id=for>What is DBOS for?</h2>

      <p>DBOS is a tool for dedicating scientific inventions to the public domain.</p>

      <h2 id=work>How does DBOS work?</h2>

      <p>DBOS helps scientists win the patent race for the public domain by publishing inventions, immediately and verifiably, with rich metadata for searching and permission to spread the word.  DBOS combines the expediency of defensive publication with the availability of open-access scholarship and the empowerment of open-source licensing.  Every DBOS publication contains:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an invention disclosure with recorded publication date</li>
        <li>metadata to help classify the invention in scientific and patent fields</li>
        <li>a public license for the publication and its attachments</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Under many countries&rsquo; patent rules, publishing an invention stops anyone, even the one publishing, from receiving a patent for what was disclosed.  Since the America Invents Act, much the same is now true under United States patent rules, with an exception: the one who published can still receive a patent by applying within one year.  Under either kind of rule, securing an invention for the public domain is a race to publish.  If a patent-seeker applies for a patent or publishes first, a patent can keep the invention closed for twenty years or more.  If a scientist publishes for the public domain first, the invention stays open, even if someone else made the same invention earlier.</p>

      <p>Scientists can submit disclosures to DBOS online, and see them published immediately.  DBOS publications meet all the requirements for patent-stopping &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; under United States and European patent rules, as well as the rules of many other countries.</p>

      <p>Prior art publications stop the most patent harm when they are clear, available, and easy to find.  A country might still issue or even enforce a patent if patent examiners, lawyers, and litigants can&rsquo;t find the earlier publication that staked a claim for the public domain.</p>

      <p>DBOS publications come with public licenses give everyone permission to copy, republish, aggregate, and adapt, like open-access articles.  The publications themselves contain information about which fields the publication belongs to, and optional attachments in standard data formats.  Others can download every publication in both person-readable and machine-readable formats.</p>

      <h2 id=compare>How does DBOS compare to other options?</h2>

      <p>
        DBOS combines aspects of a few scientific and legal
        institutions, with some new elements.

      <h3>Defensive Publication Bulletin</h3>

        <p>At a high level, DBOS is probably closest to a &ldquo;defensive publication&rdquo; journal or bulletin, such as <a href=http://www.researchdisclosure.com/>Research Disclosure</a>.  Like a defensive publication bulletin, DBOS accepts and publishes terse descriptions of new inventions and discoveries.  These descriptions qualify as prior art, preventing later patent applications.  Unlike a defensive publication bulletin, DBOS is free to use, free to access, and preserves richer metadata, making it easier to search and find records.</p>

      <h3>Traditional Journal</h3>

      <p>DBOS lets scientists describe their inventions in their own words, without translating into the legal language of patents or shoehorning into the house format of a print publication.  Scientific peers do not review DBOS publications.  Unlike traditional journal articles, DBOS publications are born digital and available to everyone, free of charge to anyone, with generous permission to copy, republish, aggregate, and adapt.</p>

      <h3>Open-Access Journal</h3>

      <p>See the <a href=#traditional-journal>comparison to traditional journals</a>.</p>

      <p>Unlike an open-access journal, DBOs publications are purpose-built to stop patents, optionally including metadata about relevant patent classifications.  DBOS publication data is much denser and easier to work with than most open-access publications.</p>

      <h3>Patent Application</h3>

      <p>Patent applications ask the government to grant patents.  DBOS publications stop patents from being issued and enforced, like the old defensive publication and statutory invention registration procedures.  Preparing a DBOS publication is much faster, easier, and cheaper than preparing a patent application, without the need to translate into the peculiar, legal language of patents, format for submissions, or interface with a regimented bureaucratic process.  DBOS publications appear immediately, worldwide.</p>

      <h3>Open License</h3>

      <p>Like an open license, DBOS publications give the public broad permissions and open materials and ideas by bringing legal terms and scientific materials together in digital form, on the Internet.  Unlike an open license, however, DBOS publications are born as well structured data, rich in useful metadata.  In this way, DBOS offers many of the benefits of combining open creative work with an open license, an Internet-based repository, and a metadata standard like <a href=https://spdx.org>Software Package Data eXchange</a>, a <a href=https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>software package file standard</a>, or <a href=https://www.w3.org/Submission/ccREL/>ccREL</a>.</p>

      <h3>Weblog</h3>

      <p>Like a weblog, DBOS allows scientists to publish to the Internet instantaneously, in a format with few inconvenient constraints, and convenient opportunity to categorize and link their disclosures for context.  Bloggers may also choose to apply open licenses to their posts.  DBOS publications offer the advantages of good, structured, machine-readable data on top of the searchability that general Internet search engines provide.  The standard format of DBOS publications, as well as their public licenses and cryptographic features, allow others to syndicate, index, aggregate, and archive them, efficiently and reliably.</p>
