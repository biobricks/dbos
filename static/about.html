      <h2 id=for>What is DBOS for?</h2>

      <p>DBOS is a tool for dedicating scientific inventions to the public domain.</p>

      <h2 id=work>How does DBOS work?</h2>

      <p>DBOS helps scientists win the patent race for the public domain by publishing inventions, immediately and verifiably, with rich metadata for searching and permission to spread the word.  DBOS combines the expediency of defensive publication with the availability of open-access scholarship and the empowerment of open-source licensing.  Every DBOS publication contains:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an invention disclosure</li>
        <li>metadata to help classify the invention in scientific and patent fields</li>
        <li>a public license for the publication and its attachments</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Under many countries&rsquo; patent rules, publishing an invention stops anyone, even the one publishing, from receiving a patent for what was disclosed.  Since the America Invents Act, much the same is now true under United States patent rules, with an exception: the one who published can still receive a patent by applying within one year.  Under either kind of rule, securing an invention for the public domain is a race to publish.  If a patent-seeker applies for a patent or publishes first, a patent can keep the invention closed for twenty years or more.  If a scientist publishes for the public domain first, the invention stays open, even if someone else made the same invention earlier.</p>

      <p>Scientists can submit disclosures to DBOS online, and see them published immediately.  DBOS publications meet all the requirements for patent-stopping &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; under United States and European patent rules, as well as the rules of many other countries.</p>

      <p>Prior art publications stop the most patent harm when they are clear, available, and easy to find.  A country might still issue or even enforce a patent if patent examiners, lawyers, and litigants can&rsquo;t find the earlier publication that staked a claim for the public domain.</p>

      <p>DBOS publications come with public licenses give everyone permission to copy, republish, aggregate, and adapt, like open-access articles.  The publications themselves contain information about which fields the publication belongs to, and optional attachments in standard data formats.  Others can download every publication in both person-readable and machine-readable formats.</p>

      <h2 id=compare>How does DBOS compare to other options?</h2>

      <p>
        DBOS combines aspects of a few scientific and legal
        institutions, with some new elements.

      <h3>Defensive Publication Bulletin</h3>

        <p>At a high level, DBOS is probably closest to a &ldquo;defensive publication&rdquo; journal or bulletin, such as <a href=http://www.researchdisclosure.com/>Research Disclosure</a>.  Like a defensive publication bulletin, DBOS accepts and publishes terse descriptions of new inventions and discoveries.  These descriptions qualify as prior art, preventing later patent applications.  Unlike a defensive publication bulletin, DBOS is free to use, free to access, and preserves richer metadata, making it easier to search and find records.</p>

      <h3>Traditional Journal</h3>

      <p>DBOS lets scientists describe their inventions in their own words, without translating into the legal language of patents or shoehorning into the house format of a print publication.  Scientific peers do not review DBOS publications.  Unlike traditional journal articles, DBOS publications are born digital and available to everyone, free of charge to anyone, with generous permission to copy, republish, aggregate, and adapt.</p>

      <h3>Open-Access Journal</h3>

      <p>See the <a href=#traditional-journal>comparison to traditional journals</a>.</p>

      <p>Unlike an open-access journal, DBOs publications are purpose-built to stop patents, optionally including metadata about relevant patent classifications.  DBOS publication data is much denser and easier to work with than most open-access publications.</p>

      <h3>Patent Application</h3>

      <p>Patent applications ask the government to grant patents.  DBOS publications stop patents from being issued and enforced, like the old defensive publication and statutory invention registration procedures.  Preparing a DBOS publication is much faster, easier, and cheaper than preparing a patent application, without the need to translate into the peculiar, legal language of patents, format for submissions, or interface with a regimented bureaucratic process.  DBOS publications appear immediately, worldwide.</p>

      <h3>Open License</h3>

      <p>Like an open license, DBOS publications give the public broad permissions and open materials and ideas by bringing legal terms and scientific materials together in digital form, on the Internet.  Unlike an open license, however, DBOS publications are born as well structured data, rich in useful metadata.  In this way, DBOS offers many of the benefits of combining open creative work with an open license, an Internet-based repository, and a metadata standard like <a href=https://spdx.org>Software Package Data eXchange</a>, a <a href=https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>software package file standard</a>, or <a href=https://www.w3.org/Submission/ccREL/>ccREL</a>.</p>

      <h3>Weblog</h3>

      <p>Like a weblog, DBOS allows scientists to publish to the Internet instantaneously, in a format with few inconvenient constraints, and convenient opportunity to categorize and link their disclosures for context.  Bloggers may also choose to apply open licenses to their posts.  DBOS publications offer the advantages of good, structured, machine-readable data on top of the searchability that general Internet search engines provide.  The standard format of DBOS publications, as well as their public licenses and cryptographic features, allow others to syndicate, index, aggregate, and archive them, efficiently and reliably.</p>

      <h2 id=fit>Is DBOS a good fit for my finding?</h2>

      <p>Nearly any kind of scientific finding is a good fit for DBOS publication, with a few exceptions you should keep in mind.</p>

      <h3>Restricted Information</h3>

      <p>DBOS publication is publication in the fullest sense of the word.  Do not publish classified information, restricted data, state secrets, or similarly sensitive material with DBOS.  Even if your invention itself does not fall under any of those categories, be sure not to include that kind of information in the description of any invention or any file attachments.</p>

      <h3>Computer Implementations &amp; Creative Works</h3>

      <p>DBOS publications are for opening inventions.  Some inventions can be implemented in computer files, like computer programs or gene sequence files, that might create copyrights.  Some inventions are easiest to explain and describe with an implementing example.  DBOS publications can attach files, bringing them under the same public license that covers the description and classification of the invention.  But standard-form public licenses like <a href=https://creativecommons.org>Creative Commons licenses</a> and <a href=https://opensource.org/licenses>open source licenses</a> may work better than DBOS publication when users will show more interest in the content and use of the files than the description of any invention.  Combining an open license with standardized metadata and hosting in a public, Internet-based repository where users are likely to look for materials of the kind can also create good prior art.</p>

      <h3>Raw Data</h3>

      <p>DBOS publications are for opening inventions.  Some inventions are easiest to explain with reference to experimental or other raw data, such as to characterize the product of a chemical or biological process whose structure cannot or has not been precisely determined.  DBOS publications can attach relatively small files, including data files, bringing them under the same public license that covers the description and classification of the invention.  However, DBOS is not the best tool, legally or technically, for disseminating data, especially data that records only facts or observations, without disclosing any new invention.  Technical tools like <a href=https://datproject.org>Dat</a> and legal tools like <a href=https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/>open database licenses</a> are better suited for those noble efforts.</p>

      <h2 id=use>Can I use DBOS?</h2>

      <p>Anyone can make new and important scientific inventions, and starts out free to dedicate them to the public domain.  However, most scientists have at least one relationship with an <a href=#academic>academic</a>, <a href=#commercial>commercial</a>, government, or nonprofit institution under legal rules, contract terms, and institutional policies that restrict their ability to disclose information, affect ownership of their inventions, and require disclosure of significant findings.  Using any legal tool, like DBOS, can create risk of legal problems under those kinds of constraints.</p>

      <p>The legal rules and terms that apply to you, your situation, and your work.  DBOS can&rsquo;t tell you exactly what restrictions apply to your or work, in this guide or otherwise.  That would require reviewing all the laws, policies, and agreements that apply to you with a lawyer who knows your practice area and your local laws.  But this guide <em>can</em> help you anticipate common situations, depending on where you do science.</p>

      <h3 id=independent>Independent Scientists</h3>

      <p class=good>Overall Risk: Low, unless terms for materials, equipment, or services apply</p>

      <p>Independent scholars, community lab users, hobbyists, and most students working on their own typically aren&rsquo;t subject to special legal rules, contracts, or policies about confidential information, trade secrets, or inventions.  That independence gives independent scientists maximum freedom to use tools like DBOS for the public domain.</p>

      <p>However, some materials, equipment, services, techniques, and information that independent scientists sometimes use come along with contract terms that restrict disclosure and change ownership of intellectual property rights.  At worst, these terms may be hidden in terms of service for online services and purchases.</p>

      <h3 id=academic>Academic Insitutions</h3>

      <p class=medium>Overall Risk: Moderate, varying with institutional policies and grant-specific terms</p>

      <p>Scientists who are faculty or staff at public and private academic institutions enjoy well established prerogative to publish science, including science that makes new and useful methods and results known to the world.  Unfortunately, that tradition has been eroded by intellectual property policies, faculty agreements, and legislation making patent protection and license-royalty-based revenue generation the default, that overreach without due thought, clarity, and protection for established scientific process.</p>

      <p>Academic institutions in the United States, for example, are nearly all subject to the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act, which gave rise to technology transfer offices focused on patenting and licensing faculty inventions.  Scientists at those institutions typically sign policy acknowledgments or contracts committing to disclose inventions to the technology transfer office as they make them, and to assign patent rights to the institution.  There are no patent rights to be assigned if publication renders an invention unpatentable, and some technology transfer offices prefer <em>not</em> to hear of inventions will end up in the public domain, to avoid creating records that may negatively impact patent applications and license agreements.</p>

      <p>A few well known research institutions&rsquo; intellectual property policies give faculty the express right to dedicate inventions to the public domain:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Leland Stanford Junior University</li>
        <li>Western Illinois University</li>
      </ol>

      <aside><p>If you believe your institution should be added to this list, please <a href=mailto:legal@biobricks.org?subject=Academic%20Public%20Domain%20Patent%20Policy>send a note with a link to the patent policy</a>.</aside>

      <p>Even among institutions that expressly permit public domain dedication, permission is subject to the overriding requirements of specific legal and contractual requirements that apply to specific projects, often as conditions of external funding.  For example, paragraph three of Stanford&rsquo;s patent policy reads:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The inventors, acting collectively where there is more than one, are free to place their inventions in the public domain if they believe that would be in the best interest of technology transfer and if doing so is not in violation of the terms of any agreements that supported or related to the work.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><em>All</em> academic scientists considering DBOL publication should take a moment to consider what peculiar grant or contract terms might apply to their inventions, and consult their institution&rsquo;s legal counsel or technology transfer office as necessary.</p>

      <p>Academic scientists who have parallel relationships with <a href=#commercial>commercial</a> firms or nonprofits should also review those sections of this guide, too.</p>

      <h3 id=government>Government Institutions</h3>

      <p class=medium>Overall Risk: Moderate, depending on applicable policies</p>

      <p>Scientists in government employ face a similar situation to those at <a href=#academic>academic institutions</a>.  While many countries&rsquo;s laws exempt government work from some kinds of intellectual property protection, such as copyright, patent often applies, and many government bodies are active patent applicants.  Under United States law, patent rights in inventions created within the scope of a government employee&rsquo;s work belong to the government.</p>

      <p>Government scientists who have parallel relationships with <a href=#academic>academic</a>, <a href=#commercial>commercial</a>, or <a href=#nonprofit>nonprofit</a> institutions should review those sections of this guide, as well.</p>

      <h3 id=commercial>Commercial Firms</h3>

      <p class=bad>Overall Risk: High</p>

      <p>As a general rule, scientists at commercial firms sign contracts that assign ownership of inventions to their employers, obligate them to promptly disclose new inventions to the company, and prohibit them from publishing broad categories of information gathered or received at work, including information about technologies and inventions.  Publishing in DBOS without specific, written permission from a company officer with legal authority to make legally binding decisions for the company would almost certainly breach that kind of agreement, and put the employee at substantial legal risk.</p>

      <p>Even in jurisdictions with statutory protections for employee intellectual property ownership of work down outside of work, without work equipment, standard form contracts for employees often go to great lengths to make separating personal from employee work procedurally and substantive difficult.  Even employees who feel they can make a strong case that they produced important work independent often find themselves unable to withstand lawsuits brought by current of former employers to secure rights in valuable inventions.</p>

      <p>While practices and even legal terms at smaller companies tend more toward openness and informality, especially when scientific or technical personnel occupy high founding and leadership positions, scientist-entrepreneurs and commercial scientists of high corporate rank are often subject to additional, unwritten legal rules flowing from their station.  Officers, directors, stockholders, and others with more than simple employer-employee relationships with a firm may have broad, fiduciary duties to one another and the firm as a whole that apply to conduct affecting intellectual property and confidential information.</p>

      <p>Commercial firms are heavy users of defensive publication services and journals, both as publishers and prior art researchers, as well as of open licenses and other permissive intellectual property tools benefiting the public commons.  BDOS publication offers many similar benefits, and some new ones.  However, as a general rule, safe company use of BDOS for publication should almost always be a choice at the company or company-counsel, rather than individual level, in keeping with defensive publication practice before BDOS.</p>

      <h3 id=nonprofit>Nonprofit Organizations</h3>

      <p>It is very difficult to generalize the legal environment of nonprofit organizations, because they vary so widely.  Scientists at nonprofit community labs or research centers may be subject to few if any relevant rules, like <a href=#independent>independent scientists</a>.  Nonprofits may also have policies and legal requirements like those of <a href=#academic>academic</a> institutions, and many academic universities are indeed nonprofit.  However, even tax-exempt nonprofits may engage in contract or other relationships that utilize <a href=#commercial>commercial</a> terms and approaches, related or unrelated to the purpose of the nonprofit.</p>
