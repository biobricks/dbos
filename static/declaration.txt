DBOS Open Inventor Declaration

Version 0.0.0

The author publicly declares:

1.  If the publication names an inventor, I am the named
    inventor.  I am not publishing in someone else's name.

2.  If the publication names an organization, I was affiliated
    with that organization when I developed the invention.

3.  As far as I know, I am the first inventor, or among the
    first coinventors.

4.  If I coinvented, I have written permission from all
    coinventors to dedicate to the public domain.

5.  Dedication to the public domain is in the best interests
    of science and society.

6.  I commit to exercise the legal rights and discretion that
    I have in the future to ensure the dedication of the
    invention to the public domain.

7.  I commit to publish a warning if I ever become aware of any
    patent for the invention, as long as I can legally do so.
